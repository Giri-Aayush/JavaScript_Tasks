Summary::
1.) Comparison operators return a boolean value.
2.) Strings are compared letter-by-letter in the “dictionary” order.
3.) When values of different types are compared, they get converted to numbers 
(with the exclusion of a strict equality check).
4.) The values null and undefined equal == each other and do not equal any other value.
5.)Be careful when using comparisons like > or < with variables that can occasionally be 
null/undefined. Checking for null/undefined separately is a good idea
