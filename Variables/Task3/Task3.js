//Examine the following code:

const birthday = '18.04.1982';

const age = someCode(birthday);

//Would it be right to use upper case for birthday? For age? Or even for both?
/* NOTE:
 The age is calculated from birthday using someCode(), which means a function call
 that we didn’t explain yet (we will soon!), but the details don’t matter here, the point 
 is that age is calculated somehow based on the birthday.
